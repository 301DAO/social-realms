-note: If you don't have `pnpm` installed you can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`. Alternatively, you can use `npm` instead of `pnpm`.

To get started:

```
pnpm install
```

Then,

```
pnpm run dev
```

If you want to run locally as https:

```
npm run dev-https
```

Why you would want to run locally as https is for many reasons. One of which is to be able to access the browser `window.navigation.clipboard` object.

When you run `npm run dev-https`, you will have `http://localhost:3000` and `https://localhost:3001` running.
